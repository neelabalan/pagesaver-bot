# pagesaver-bot

> pagesaver is a telegram bot I wrote for my personal bookmarking use. I thought I can leverage the telegram's cross platform software for bookmarking webpages. There are some known hiccups because I am using my own telegram bot library here. I am running this bot locally from my raspberry pi.



## dependency

I am using [monolith](https://github.com/Y2Z/monolith) to bundle the webpage to single HTML file



## start the bot

``` bash
python bot.py
```
